Given an integer array nums with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.

Notice:

A number in the array can be used multiple times in the combination. 
Different orders are counted as different combinations.

Example
<pre>
Given nums = [1, 2, 4], target = 4

The possible combination ways are:
[1, 1, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 2]
[1, 2, 1]
[2, 1, 1]
[2, 2]
[4]
return 6
</pre>
